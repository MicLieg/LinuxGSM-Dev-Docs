# Shellcheck Linter

## Introduction

ShellCheck is a static analysis tool that gives warnings and suggestions for bash/sh shell scripts. It is mainly focused on handling typical beginner and intermediate level syntax errors and pitfalls where the shell just gives a cryptic error message or strange behavior, but it also reports on a few more advanced issues where corner cases can cause delayed failures.
