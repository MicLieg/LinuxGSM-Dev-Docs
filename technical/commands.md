## Commands

Within LinuxGSM there are many commands that a user will run to complete tasks such as start, stop, monitor, and details. Command scripts are stored will all other modules and are always named something like `command_install.sh`. See the [Commands](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/commands) page for more info.

Some game servers may require bespoke commands to complete tasks. Examples of this include Teamspeak 3 and Unreal Tournament 2004. Take a look at the `core_getopts.sh` module for examples of how to add commands.
